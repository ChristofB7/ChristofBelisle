                          The history of Cookwell goes as far back as my history with coding.
                          This project started in winter 2018 when I had when I learned the power of programming.
                          I found myself learning to cook meals in college, eager to learn and improve and my new found hobby.
                          When I tried new things, I would search up an "easy college" recipe and give it a shot.
                          The next week when I was craving the same meal I would find myself searching and searching and not able to find it.
                          So I wanted to create a way to store recipes.
                          That's when Cookwell hit me.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          At the time, there was not much out there. It was mostly lackluster apps and web sites that only allowed their own recipes.
                          So I started creating the project in Java.
                          I didn't have much experience with the langauge, and I had never seen any graphics except for outputting to the console.
                          It wasn't until 3 semesters later in fall of 2019 when Designing Mobile Apps CS230 was offered.
                          The course outline stated that we would publish an app on the app store by the end of the course.
                          Fast forward to the end of 2019 on December 13, Cookwell was released for android devices.
                          With a total of 1 user this was something that I was happy to have worked on.
                        </p>

                            I was happy to have worked on Cookwell and further improve the idea and get a nice first taste of what Cookwell could be.
                            But this did not reach nearly 50% of its potential. Its UI was terrible, the functionality was forced onto Firebase (Google's free database), and stuck on just android.
                            I wanted more from it. It wasn't until a year later in 2020 that I would find something more suitable.
                            Given the opportunity I was allowed to do an independent study where I was given free reign on what I wanted to learn.
                            So I scoured articles and sites figuring out the best way to learn mobile app design and create something for multiple platforms.
                            I chose to learn Dart through a udemy course and leverage it to re-create cookwell.
                            I was able to give the app a better look, feel and most importantly it can go to android and iOS at the same time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Cookwell has evolved from its original state to an idea, into an app, and now a prototype for Android and iOS.
                          The project has developed in parallel with the developer behind it. I've learned a lot from this project, from the basics of OOP, to UI, to multiplatform developing.
                          The project has taken me through 3 IDEs and many iterations. I cannot stress how much I've learned from the app. I may not have much to share, but the learning has been immense.
                          Overall, the app still needs a lot of work. Flutter and Dart has all of the tools required to make Cookwell the next big thing.
                          The next steps are to devote time off to complete it.
