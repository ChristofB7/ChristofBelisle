                              Cookwell has been a dream of mine for a while. During University when I began to understand the power of Java I started
                              on an idea that would manage my recipes. It was an easy way to put together two passions - coding and cooking. Today its now being developed
                              as a Flutter and Dart project for iOS and Android.
                        </p>





                          <div class="text-center" style="margin-top: 0px">
                            <h2>Early Development</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p class="tab">
                        The first prototype was rough, while just learning the basics, I started by creating recipes and outputting them to the console. With no knowledge on graphics or
                        UI I hit my first stopping point. The project had never really left my mind, but I had stopped working on it. When my school offered designing mobile apps
                        for the first time I could see the project in a new light. With the class forcing us to publish an app to the app store this was the first version of Cookwell.
                        It had released for android and was a rough design.
                        </p>


                        <p class="tab">
                        It became clear that the UI needed some real work - we needed to change the way the app looked and functioned. The functionality was there - utilizing firebase to store
                        basic user information, their recipes and a search function. The app really need a retune. The main reason we decided to change the development from android studio and Java
                        was because we wanted to release to Android and iOS at the same time. So we looked at our options.

                        After doing research there were many factors that came into consideration. We had narrowed it down to React Native and Flutter and Dart.
                        Looking at the documentation flutter and dart had won my heart. It ultimately came down to what we were comfortable with. I had no experience
                        with JavaScript at the time and decided that if I were to learn a new language I should dive in. Flutter's motto was, at the time, "Develope beautiful apps quickly",
                        and that settled it for me. I had made my choice. We would develop in the language started by Google in 2018.

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final colorScheme = Theme.of(context).colorScheme;
      final textTheme = Theme.of(context).textTheme;
      return Scaffold(
          drawer: Drawer(
            child: Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.only(top: 20.0),
              child: Column(
                children: <Widget>[
                  navigationItemListTitle(RECIPES, _recipeMenu),
                  navigationItemListTitle(SHOPPING, _shoppingMenu),
                  navigationItemListTitle("Search", SearchRecipes()),
                  navigationItemListTitle("MyCookbook", MyCookbook())
                ],
              ),
            ),
          ),
          ...
</code></pre>

                        <p>
                        Taking a course on Udemy, learning as I go, developing other apps as well as re-creating cookwell in Flutter was a blast.
                        Falling in love with the way the code looked - the widgets, and the simplicity of it all really gave me a new found passion for
                        the dream project of mine. As life got hectic with my last semester - an internship, and a full course load meant I had to put aside
                        the project, but I am ever so ready to get started on it once again.
